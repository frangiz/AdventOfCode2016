# AdventOfCode2016
My solution for the project [AdventOfCode2016](http://adventofcode.com/).

## TODO
* Create animation for Day6.
* Breakout computer for Day 12 and 23 to AssemBunny
* Improve performance of AssemBunny. Day23 part2 takes way to long time (4-5 mins).
* Move input files to own dir and do not include them in the sln. Add a build event to include them for both projects.
* Add check of the answer in the testcases before refactoring any code.
* Run all days and mark the slow ones.
* Try to improve the execution time for the slow days.
* Solve Day24.
* Solve Day25.
